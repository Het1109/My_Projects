This project is a **Caesar Cipher Encoder/Decoder** with a graphical user interface (GUI) built using Python's `turtle` module. It allows users to encode or decode messages using the Caesar Cipher algorithm in an interactive and visually appealing way.

---

## Features

- **Encode/Decode Messages**: Easily encode or decode text using the Caesar Cipher.
- **Interactive GUI**: Built with Python's `turtle` module for a simple and clean interface.
- **Customizable Shift**: Choose a shift value between 1 and 25 for encoding or decoding.
- **User-Friendly**: Input fields and buttons make it easy to use.

## How It Works

The Caesar Cipher is one of the simplest encryption techniques. It works by shifting each letter in the plaintext by a fixed number of positions down or up the alphabet. For example, with a shift of 3:
- **Encode**: "hello" â†’ "khoor"
- **Decode**: "khoor" â†’ "hello"

This project implements the Caesar Cipher algorithm and provides a GUI for users to interact with.

## Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/caesar-cipher-turtle.git
   cd caesar-cipher-turtle
   ```

2. **Run the Program**:
   Ensure you have Python 3.x installed. Run the following command:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

## Usage

1. **Enter Text**: Type the message you want to encode or decode.
2. **Enter Shift**: Choose a shift value between 1 and 25.
3. **Click Buttons**:
   - Click **[ Encode ]** to encode the message.
   - Click **[ Decode ]** to decode the message.
4. **View Result**: The encoded or decoded message will be displayed on the screen.
