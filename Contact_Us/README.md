# Interactive Card Section Project 💳  

Welcome to the **Interactive Card Section Project**! This is a fun, responsive webpage designed using **HTML** and **CSS**, featuring visually engaging card elements. Each card includes text, icons, and action elements to simulate a real-world application, such as a payment or social media platform.  

This project is part of my **100 Days of Code Challenge**, where I enhance my web development skills by building creative projects daily!

## Features ✨  
- **Responsive Design:** Cards are styled to adapt seamlessly across different screen sizes.  
- **Icon Integration:** Uses visually appealing icons for better user engagement.  
- **Interactive Layout:** Organized card structure with hover and click actions to enhance the user experience.  
- **Custom Styling:** Styling achieved through external CSS for modularity and easy maintenance.

## How It Works 🛠️  
1. **Structure:**  
   - The project contains an **HTML** file (`index.html`) for layout.  
   - Styles are managed through a linked **CSS** file (`style.css`).  
2. **Visual Elements:**  
   - Each card features an icon, heading, description, and action button.  
   - Secondary icons are included to create a visually dynamic experience.  
3. **Purpose:**  
   - Ideal for use in payment interfaces, product showcases, or social media landing pages.
