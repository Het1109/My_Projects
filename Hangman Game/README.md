# Hangman Game 🎮  

Welcome to the **Hangman Game**, a classic word-guessing game built using Python. This project is part of my **100 Days of Code Challenge**, where I'm working on fun and interactive projects to sharpen my coding skills!  

## Features ✨  
- **Word List Import:** Uses a modular word list to make the game dynamic.  
- **Visual Feedback:** Displays lives remaining and updates the placeholder word after every guess.  
- **Repeated Guess Handling:** Notifies players when they guess a letter they've already guessed.  
- **End Game Logic:**  
  - Celebrates when the player wins.  
  - Reveals the correct word when the player loses.  
- **ASCII Art Stages:** Adds fun visual elements during the game!  

## How It Works 🛠️  
1. **Start the Game:** Run the Python script to begin the game.  
2. **Guess a Letter:** Input a single letter at each turn.  
3. **Lives System:**  
   - Correct guesses reveal the letter(s) in the word.  
   - Incorrect guesses reduce your lives.  
4. **Win or Lose:** The game ends when you guess the word or lose all your lives.
