## Notes ‚ö†Ô∏è

1. **LinkedIn Restrictions**:
   - LinkedIn may block automated scripts if used aggressively. Use responsibly!
   - Avoid running the script too frequently to prevent account restrictions.

2. **Dynamic Selectors**:
   - LinkedIn‚Äôs UI changes frequently. Update XPATH/CSS selectors if the script breaks.

3. **Resume Requirement**:
   - Ensure your resume is pre-uploaded to LinkedIn under *"Job Application Settings"*.

4. **Multi-Job Application**:
   - The looped multi-application feature is commented out. Test carefully before enabling.
