# 🐍 Snake Game Project By Het 

This repository contains a fully functional **Snake Game** built using Python's `turtle` module. The game is designed to be lightweight, portable, and engaging, with a built-in high-score system for tracking your best performances.

## 🎮 How to Play  

1. Use the arrow keys to control the snake's direction:  
   - **Up Arrow**: Move up  
   - **Down Arrow**: Move down  
   - **Left Arrow**: Move left  
   - **Right Arrow**: Move right  

2. The objective is to:  
   - **Eat the food** to grow your snake and increase your score.  
   - **Avoid hitting the walls or yourself**, or the game will reset with your current score saved.  

3. Your high score is stored persistently in a `highscore.txt` file and updates when you break the record.
