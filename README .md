# Turtle Graphics Projects  

This repository contains fun and interactive **Turtle Graphics** projects built with Python. These projects help visualize programming concepts, practice event-driven programming, and explore the creative potential of the **turtle module**.

## 🚀 Projects  

### 1️⃣ Turtle Controller 🐢  
A program where you control a turtle's movements using your keyboard.  

#### Features:  
- **W**: Move forward.  
- **S**: Move backward.  
- **A/D**: Rotate left/right by 10 degrees.  
- **C**: Clear the screen and reset the turtle's position.  

#### Key Concepts:  
- Handling **keyboard events** using `onkey()`.  
- Manipulating Turtle’s heading and movement properties.  

### 2️⃣ Turtle Race Game 🏁  
An interactive race game where you can bet on a turtle's color and watch the race unfold!  

#### Features:  
- Bet on one of six colored turtles: Red, Green, Blue, Black, Orange, or Yellow.  
- Watch the race and find out if your chosen turtle wins.  
- Randomized movement makes every race exciting and unpredictable.  

#### Key Concepts:  
- Creating multiple Turtle instances with unique properties (color, position).  
- Using `Screen.textinput()` to accept user input.  
- Randomizing movement with `random.randint()`.
